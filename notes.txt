## Server-side notes

https://stackoverflow.com/questions/43161353/recordstotal-recordsfiltered-explanation-jquery-datatable

From the (official documentation)[https://datatables.net/manual/server-side#Returned-data]:

```
recordsTotal
   Total records, before filtering (i.e. the total number of records in the database)

recordsFiltered
   Total records, after filtering (i.e. the total number of records after filtering has been applied - not just the number of records being returned for this page of data).
```

Response should be:

```
{
    "draw": 1,
    "recordsTotal": 10000,
    "recordsFiltered": 3000,
    "data": [
       // ... skipped 20 records ...
    ]
}
```

Initiate request:
```
$('#datatables-4').dataTable( {
"processing": true,
"serverSide": true,
"order": [[ 3, "desc" ]],
"ajax": baseUrl+"shoes/ProcessingDatatables"
}
```

- Perhaps it should say recordsTotal: BIG NUMBER and recordsFiltered: small nubers
